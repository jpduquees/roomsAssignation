The purpose of this code is to develop an algorithm capable of defining the routes that groups of between 4 and 10 people should take in a space with nxm available rooms. The code receives each group and the routine it will perform and returns the ideal route to minimize encounters with people already in the system, considering not only the number of people but also the time spent with them.
